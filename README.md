# Overview

This project is a simple **Hello World** program, one of the most fundamental exercises in software development. My goal with this project is to build a solid foundation in programming by starting small, practicing version control, and documenting my work clearly.  

The software simply outputs the phrase **"Hello, World!"** to the screen. While simple, it represents an important first step in learning any new programming language and serves as a foundation for building more complex applications later.  

The purpose of creating this software is to strengthen my understanding of coding basics, program execution, and proper project documentation practices that I can apply to larger, real-world projects.
